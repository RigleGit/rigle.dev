If you don&rsquo;t have the security code handy, you might end up in a situation where the radio emits constant beeps or shows an &ldquo;ERROR&rdquo; message that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to input anything.</p>
<p>After a couple of days of testing and searching internet forums, I&rsquo;ve managed to find the key to getting everything working and re-entering the code, so I&rsquo;m writing it down here in case it helps someone else:</p>]]></description></item><item><title>md-to-pdf-exams: Create exams in Markdown and automatically generate PDFs</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/md-to-pdf-exams-crear-examenes-markdown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/md-to-pdf-exams-crear-examenes-markdown/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

    <a href="#the-problem-of-working-across-multiple-operating-systems" class="header-mark"></a>The problem of working across multiple operating systems</h2><p>Like many computer science teachers, I&rsquo;ve been jumping from one operating system to another. But in my case, I&rsquo;ve ended up regularly using all three: <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>macOS</strong>, and <strong>Fedora</strong>.</p>
<p>While being &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; helps me properly test Flutter development, it has forced me to find solutions that work regardless of which system I&rsquo;m using at any given moment.</p>
<p>For many years, <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> was my main tool for creating class content. It works perfectly on Windows and macOS, but when I switched to Linux, the available alternatives simply&hellip; weren&rsquo;t up to par, to put it mildly. <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice</a> is functional, but the compatibility and final result aren&rsquo;t comparable. <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ONLYOFFICE</a> is decent, but it has also given me some issues if you want cross-platform compatibility.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Welcome to the blog</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/bienvenida/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/bienvenida/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="hello" class="headerLink">

As soon as we lose in a tournament set match, our mind tells us that we need to improve something, since the other person did it better than us or we failed too many things. Playing a competitive game requires constant improvement to maintain the level.</p>
<p>Lately there have been some very good videos on the subject on <a href="https://smashbrosspain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smash Bros Spain</a>, but I decided to make a small introduction about what our path to improvement should be. I hope you like it!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My Podcasting and Streaming Setup</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/mi-setup-de-podcasting-y-streaming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/mi-setup-de-podcasting-y-streaming/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

There are elements that could be improved, such as the microphone, since although it has acceptable quality, there are much better ones that capture less noise. However, for my current situation it is more than enough to provide <strong>good quality</strong>.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Xubuntu 18.04 on the T100TA</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/xubuntu-1804-en-el-t100ta/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 09:31:07 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/xubuntu-1804-en-el-t100ta/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

    <a href="#windows-hates-me" class="header-mark"></a>Windows hates me</h2><p>This change started with the new update of Microsoft OS, <strong>Windows 10</strong>. I wanted to test it on my tablet, an <strong>Asus Transformer T100</strong>, to see how it was going. Even though I read a lot about its lack of privacy, I was also curious about all the changes like <strong>multi-desktop support</strong> (which both Linux and Macintosh have since ages) and <strong>Cortana</strong>, which offered a lot of <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2874400/windows/windows-10-the-10-coolest-features-you-should-check-out-first.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a> that seemed to be useful.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My first experience with Jekyll</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/my-first-experience-with-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/my-first-experience-with-jekyll/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>After almost seven years using <a href="https://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogger</a> as my main blogging services, I have decided to change my mind, make a step forward and install a simple web/blog with a great frontend and without a complex database and their vulnerabilities. Furthermore, I do not like the feeling of Wordpress owning the content of my blog because it is hosted there.</p>
<p>Having a look at the possibilities I decided to try <strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a></strong> on <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a></strong>. Jekyll is a simple web/blog engine written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a> using static pages as entries and posts, so… no more databases!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
