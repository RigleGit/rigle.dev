As soon as we lose in a tournament set match, our mind tells us that we need to improve something, since the other person did it better than us or we failed too many things. Playing a competitive game requires constant improvement to maintain the level.</p>
<p>Lately there have been some very good videos on the subject on <a href="https://smashbrosspain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smash Bros Spain</a>, but I decided to make a small introduction about what our path to improvement should be. I hope you like it!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My Podcasting and Streaming Setup</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/mi-setup-de-podcasting-y-streaming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/mi-setup-de-podcasting-y-streaming/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>It&rsquo;s been 5 months since I started recording the <a href="https://youtube.com/c/ElUltimoFrame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El Último Frame</a> podcast with almost weekly frequency, and after this time I think I&rsquo;ve achieved a pretty decent recording setup. There are elements that could be improved, such as the microphone, since although it has acceptable quality, there are much better ones that capture less noise. However, for my current situation it is more than enough to provide <strong>good quality</strong>.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Xubuntu 18.04 on the T100TA</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/xubuntu-1804-en-el-t100ta/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 09:31:07 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/xubuntu-1804-en-el-t100ta/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>After seeing the latest updates in the kernels, consulting the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117853703024346186936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Plus group</a> and the new guide they made describing the installation process in a simple way, I ventured to have Linux on the little one again. In addition, a large part of the problems that existed (physical buttons didn&rsquo;t work, nor the backlight, nor the microphone&hellip;) have been solved.</p>
<p>As I already explained in <a href="https://areidz.github.io/blog/linux-on-asus-transformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the entry</a> that I wrote in English a few years ago, the first thing I did was a backup of the entire hard drive with <a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macrium Reflect</a>, since it only has 64GB maximum and, in case I break something I shouldn&rsquo;t, I prefer to have the entire copy.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Linux on my Asus T100TA</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/linux-on-my-asus-t100ta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/linux-on-my-asus-t100ta/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>This entry is going to be my <strong>linux diary</strong>, so I can keep on records the stuff I&rsquo;m doing on the tablet. Well, let&rsquo;s start from the beginning:</p>
<h2 id="windows-hates-me" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#windows-hates-me" class="header-mark"></a>Windows hates me</h2><p>This change started with the new update of Microsoft OS, <strong>Windows 10</strong>. I wanted to test it on my tablet, an <strong>Asus Transformer T100</strong>, to see how it was going. Even though I read a lot about its lack of privacy, I was also curious about all the changes like <strong>multi-desktop support</strong> (which both Linux and Macintosh have since ages) and <strong>Cortana</strong>, which offered a lot of <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2874400/windows/windows-10-the-10-coolest-features-you-should-check-out-first.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a> that seemed to be useful.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My first experience with Jekyll</title><link>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/my-first-experience-with-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author><name>Rodrigo Iglesias</name></author><guid>https://rigle.dev/en/posts/my-first-experience-with-jekyll/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>After almost seven years using <a href="https://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogger</a> as my main blogging services, I have decided to change my mind, make a step forward and install a simple web/blog with a great frontend and without a complex database and their vulnerabilities. Furthermore, I do not like the feeling of Wordpress owning the content of my blog because it is hosted there.</p>
<p>Having a look at the possibilities I decided to try <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a></strong> on <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a></strong>. Jekyll is a simple web/blog engine written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a> using static pages as entries and posts, so… no more databases!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
